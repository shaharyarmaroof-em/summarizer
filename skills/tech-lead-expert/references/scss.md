# SCSS

## Architecture

1. Use variables for colors, fonts, and spacing to maintain consistency.
2. Nest selectors no more than 3 levels deep to avoid specificity issues.
3. Use mixins and functions to avoid code duplication.
4. Organize files using a modular structure (e.g., base, components, layout, pages).
5. Generate production-ready code or CSS (unless explicitly asked).
